# Introductory Birds of a Feather Sessions

## Goal

* Bring newbies into the fold for skills and confidence to play in a variety of infosec conference games
* (and learn cool stuff in the process!)
* Openly developed and maintained curriculum so anyone with sufficient skills can present this anywhere
* Maybe 1 or 2 hour sessions, provide basic intro, few introductory level challenges, instruction and support
* Not intended for contests -- want to remove the pressure (and team secrecy) associated with contests
* But perfectly reasonable to have some simple prizes giveaways for participants (say, crypto books, etc.)

## Topics

Frequent subjects at information security conferences -- things like:

* cryptography (classical crypto, steganography, puzzles, etc.)
* wireless CTF (wifi and bluetooth, fox and hound)
* traditional CTF (hacking)
* even things like Ham Radio exams, etc.


## What next?
