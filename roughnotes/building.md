# How To Build a Workshop

We need a basic outline of a process.

* Perhaps a top-level list of topics in development?
* once someone "stakes a claim" to the topic, they add it to the list
* start with the basic template and fill out basic data
* then add the overall outline
* then start to fill it in

Basically, like writing a con talk, but without the formal CFP process. 

Then, they get added as contributors to the git project and create a
branch for their workshop. Or maybe we handle it as pull requests, and
once maintainers have checked over what's been built, they can accept the
new workshop into the main repository?

This may require some more thinking, or at least, ideas from someone
who's worked more collaborative github projects...
