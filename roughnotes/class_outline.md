# First shot at rough outline for class materials


* audience
* expected duration
* slides, exercises, answers to exercises
* instructor guide?
* suggested approach to teaching?
* are giveaways appropriate? like what?
* What's required:
    * provided by venue / con: room, X chairs, tables?, projector, screen
    * provided by instructor: laptop for slides, handouts, etc.?
    * what does attendee need to bring? paper, pen, computer, software, rPI
* topic difficulty - try to define each level, not just use labels
    * introductory - never touched it before
    * beginner - have a rough idea, but never played seriously
    * intermediate - have worked with it before and ready for next steps
    * advanced - really good at it but want to learn the crazy leet stuff
* "owner" of the class - list of people, with contact info, who are maintaining it
* some way to have a history of times it's been offered
    * both just to track how popular the material is
    * also to track some comments and make notes for improvements
    * can be as simple as a block with:
        * date / location 
        * how many classes given / how many people total
        * who presented it
        * any thoughts from the participants or the instructor -- did it go well, what problems did you have, etc.
        * a note as to whether these thoughts have been incorporated into the wiki / issues list
        * periodically, some SME / admin / stuck-ee will review notes and try to turn them into actionable issues, changes, etc., as appropriate
        * keeping it simple for the instructors -- they can also just email comments to some maintainer for the class, if they don't want to deal with git
